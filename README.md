# project-GraceC-326
Grace Cochran's Final project for COS 135.

This directory contains a plagarism-checking program, which will take two user inputted filenames, compare the two files one line at a time, and print a statement depending on whether one or more of the lines matched exactly.
  
The program has basic instructions on how to navigate its interface, with listed actions being executable by entering the action's corresponding number in the interface. 
  
When comparing two files to be checked for plagarism, please use the provided .txt files in the directory, as there is not an option in the interface to create your own. You will be prompted when to do this and how in the program.

Something not explicitly taught in COS 135 that I used in this program is the coloration of the text on the program's interface.
